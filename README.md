# Sample editions cli

libreplex_editions allows the creation of open editions (copies of identical mints). the core program does not allow whitelists / creator fees. Both WL and creator fees are added via a separate wrapper contract.


## Getting Started

It is highly recommended you check out libreplex_program_library (especially libreplex_editions for the rust source code).

## Installation

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Create a deployment

Create a deployment with symbol "eee" and json https://www.google.com on solana mainnet (make sure that you have used solana-keygen to generate a new identify key.
Also please make sure you have some SOL in the account to cover rent costs.

```bash
yarn createDeployment -k ~/.config/solana/id.json -s eee -j https://www.google.com -r https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
```
Note down the address id of your collection.
